# Occupancy Monte Carlo Simulation

This repository contains the simulation code for generating and analysing meeting room occupancy using a Monte Carlo approach. It includes:

- Artificial meeting schedule generation
- Probability mass function (PMF) estimation
- Confidence intervals and cancellation probability analysis

This tool is designed for academic research on shared space utilisation and stochastic scheduling. It allows users to generate synthetic meeting room schedules for analysis. The visualisation and statistical analysis in the associated study were performed on generated datasets and are not included here.
